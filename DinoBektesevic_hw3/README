.SH SYNOPSIS
Time generatelist and findodd and compare it to provided implementation.
I conclude my implementation is faster.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Recompile the generatelist and findodd from HW1 and HW2 to include optimizations.
    scl enable devtoolset-6 bash
    g++ -std=c++17 -O3 generatelist.cpp -o generatelist
    g++ -std=c++17 -O3 findodd.cpp -o findodd

Separate the three test instances into 3 folders: six, seven and eight. Each
foldername is determined as log(N), where N is the number of test datapoints. 

Time execution trice for each of the given cases for both my and given 
implementation. Plot is produced using Python and matplotlib. I conclude my
