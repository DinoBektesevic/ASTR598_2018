.SH SYNOPSIS
Plot Amdahl's law for varying number of processors and parallelizability 
and answer the following questions:
    1) what's the maximal number of processors you would need to use for p?
    2) What's the meaning of p=1?
    3) What's Amdahls law when p=1?
    4) What is the assymptotic behaviour when N-->inf.?
    
.SH DESCRIPTION
1) 
p    estimated n
0.5     not more than 60, realistically max 20
0.6     not more than 80, realistically max 40
0.7     not more than 100, realistically max 70
0.8     not more than 120, realistically max 80
0.9     a lot, realistically will max 140
0.95    at these parallelizabilities, everything up to IO bottlenecks

2) P marks the parallelizable portion of the program, the portion that
benefits from parallelization. When p=1 the whole program is paralelizable
trivially. 

3) When that happens Amdahl's law can be written as: 
    S(N, p) = N

essentially stating that the speedup will be equal to the number of 
processors one can dedicate to the problem. 

4) When N-->inf. Amdahl's law can be rewritten as 
    lim_{N-->inf.} S(N, p) = 1/(1-p)

which is essentially saying that the maximal speedups one can achieve
depend on the size of the portion of the program that is parallelizable.
Thus if only half of the program is parallelizable the maximal achieved 
speedup will be 2x, as the non-parallelizable portion of the program sets
the minimal execution time. This behaviour is reproduced in the graph, marked
by a dotted black line.

.SH COMPILING 
python3, matplotlib

.SH BUGS
Could possibly work with Python 2, untested.
